# Mobile-Palmprint-Database
A contactless palmprint database was established by Dr. Shuping Zhao, named Mobile PV1, in uncontrolled and uncooperative environments randomly using different types of mobile phones, i.e., Android, iPhone. When we collected the samples, the hands of the volunteers were free without any constraints. Since both the hand and the device were not fixed, there are a lot of recognition interference factors, such as rotation, scale inconsistency, and tilt, in the palmprint images. The database totally includes 13,440 palm images acquired from 210 volunteers in the range of age 18-25 years. Since each person was required to provide both of their left and right hands for imaging, this database totally contains 420 classes.
